===== DEFINITION: <nowiki> WikiWord</nowiki> =
A WikiWord is a word written in such a way as to create a link to a wiki page.  A <nowiki>WikiWord</nowiki> is any word which contains at least two upper case letters, separated by at least one lower case letter.  

If the <nowiki>WikiWord</nowiki> is inserted, but the page to which it references doesn't exist, save the changes to the page.  Afterwards, view the current page and find that a hyperlink has been created.  Click on that hyperlink to create and edit the new page.

Be aware that setting up such links but not fulfilling them with content by creating a new page, a condition named [MeatBall:WantedPages WantedPages] exists for that page.  Not quite a problem when you have a few authors doing this, but a big headached when the wiki becomes strewn with links that lead to nowhere.
