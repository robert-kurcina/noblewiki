This page is an example of real content.  It's not very deep or broad in it's presentation of a particular topic, but it is concise.  Other examples of real content would be deeper pages like NobleWiki, NoblePursuit, and WikiStyleGuide.  Those pages have a lot more text for sure, but they are a bit later in the stages of writing.  However, since this is a wiki, all content is living, changing, forever being open to quick revision.  In that sense, all pages in a wiki are still yet DraftContent.
