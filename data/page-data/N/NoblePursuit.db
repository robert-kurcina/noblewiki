== Traditional Gaming =
Tabletop miniature games, paper-and-pencil games, role-playing games, boardgames, and all varieties of card games.  These games focus on skill, theme, luck, and the social interaction with visible and present humans.  Imagination, presence, and socialization are key facets that such games either enhance or provide.  It's been that way for traditional games for thousands of years.  However, things do change.  In the modern world, it is very difficult to find suitable players and conditions to engage in such gaming entertainment because of the arrival of the Internet and the on-line gaming scene.

=== Knowing Humans =
It's actually good to have other venues to acquire entertainment besides traditional games.  But there's a certain lack of feedback mechanism that a player would get from being in the physical presence of another; there's the body language, the fidelity of vocal exchange, the tactile feel of the gaming components, and all the related expression of being near a human.  On the one hand, while on the Internet you never really know if the person on the other side has bathed in a while, but do enjoy the safety of your own home without needing to leave it.  Quite insular and 'safe'.  On the other hand, you miss out on the natural signals that a human presence exudes that would enable you to easily bond with them.  The five sense; sight, hearing, smell, touch, and ... taste.  

=== IRL :: In-Real-Life =
That's right; you miss out on the social aspect of dining together as well.  When playing traditional games in the presence of company, there's more to it than the gaming itself.  You live life with the other persons; it's very hard to not learn more about them.  On-line, the games are indeed engaging and revolutionary, but when you're done gaming it is likely the person on the otherside of the city, state, country, or world doesn't segue afterwards with you for minutes or hours.  Isolation is a large problem with members of today's society, and distances will increase physically though communications networks will bring people more opportunities to socialize.  However, the relationships of on-line gamers generally tend to be distant, because the dynamic of human interaction is not necessarily the key to victory for computer games; beating the game is.  The friendships you make while present with another human are formed easier with traditional games because of the other shared aspects of living that on-line games have yet been able to simulate.

=== The Halcyon Days =
It is unlikely that traditional gaming will ever disappear, but it is quite possible that on-line games will begin to either acquire greater versimilitude or that the culture of gaming will migrate entirely into the Internet leaving no champions of yesterday's games.  I think that both situations are a long way in the future.

=== The Noble Pursuit =
So, the "noble pursuit" of Noble Pursuit Games is to champion what may be a lost cause, a culture of gaming that still persists and thrives, but must eventually give way to the new.  Perhaps it will take 20 years, or sooner if [WikiPedia:Vernor_Vinge Vernor Vinge's] singularity arrives earlier and [WikiPedia:The_matrix The Matrix] consumes us all.  Until that time, traditional gaming has never been better; manufacturing quality is very high, as well as artistry in illustration, sculpting of the gaming pieces, the story-writing, and elegance of game design.  So, we champions of these traditional games have much to look forward to.  And when the time comes to exit this world, we'll just plug into the next because it'll be ready for us by then.
