== Vision =
It is hoped that this wiki will serve the on-line community well and grow into a larger service to augment tabletop and paper games, as well as a communications hub for the various contributors and subscribers to the content herein.

== Acquire and Account =
If you are a new visitor, apply for an editor's password in order to gain access to the more advanced editor features like file upload and management.  If you are an editor and want to do more, then apply for an administrator's password; be sure to first gain the trust of all the other administrators.  Otherwise, as an anonymous guest, you can always browse the existing content and add new pages as you'd like.

== How to Contribute =
There are several parallel projects in development.  Contribute to one or more projects later; pick a single project for now and focus on one or more of its tasks.  For example, for the [GRoWWII Giant Robots of World War II] project there's need for history, [GRoWWII/TOandE Tables of Organization and Equipment], and rules documentation.
