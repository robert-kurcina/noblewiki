A "noble game" is one that acknowledges it's history even though it is marketed for the next generations.  It is a neo-classic game that fuses elegant mechanics into a complex subject matter to simulate something of worth.  The history of a noble game includes ancestors that were played with a modicum of gravity on the one lineage, and with a modicum of relevance on the other.  Both tend to make for serious games.  Gravity - how much a game tends towards serious competitive play - is acquired by descent from Go, Checkers, and Chess.  Very classic stuff.  Relevance - how much about society or history can be gleaned from a game - is acquired from the conflict simulation games like Advanced Squad Leader, 1776, or even Federation & Empire.

Those are good games because they each were great diversions, but could - in each their own way - consume a player beyond the gametable. Compare these to the lighter fare of today's games - Amerigames, or Eurogames - and one will find a greater amount of replay value from the older games on average.  It may seem to be an unfair comparison, or even judgment, but it is true; today's games are more about clever mechanics and ease of play.  Very few can become the new classics because very few desire to generate gravity or have topics of relevance.  Actually, most are a bit frivilous because their design and artwork are geared toward use by families or NonGamers for QuickPlay.

Some of these modern games though come very close to being, or are already 'noble'.  Some are games with 'name recgonition' as well; <nowiki>EuroFront II</nowiki>, Die Macher, and even The Settlers of Catan.  Each of those three are unique but noble in their own way.  <nowiki>EuroFront II</nowiki> utilizes fog-of-war extremely effectively, and keeps the number of rules to a relative minimum in comparison to other theater of war conflict simulations.  Die Macher is a detailed analysis of the political process but brings it into an intense but playable simulation.  'The Settlers of Catan' brings in elements of chance, trade/barter, and society-building.  All are worthy of a game-table, or reference at a party.
