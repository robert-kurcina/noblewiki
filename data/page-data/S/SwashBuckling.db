Swashbuckling is a battle between two or more cavalier medieval weapon masters of extra-ordinary ability, dueling out to the death upon terrifying precipices or at the edges of a ruined fortress' battlements. Or not; the fighters are after-all refined in the courtesy and mannerisms as well, and so perhaps the duels might end with just a slight cut and a nod.

The introductory game provides the core rules of play and can be resolved in 15-30 minutes.  The intermediate game introduces to the players the use of characters as well as the use of the ace cards.  The standard game provides for more options in play to prepare the gamers for the advanced game.  It is with this final section of rules the game introduces character customization, battlefield customization, and mission-oriented adventures.

== Theme and Setting =
The core game mechanic is card-driven combat using 2D maps to track unit position.  The play of the game is through the conventions of a stylized poker game using decorative cards and poker chips.  The setting will initially be 16th Century Medieval Europe, but in planning is the introduction of other cultures.  Each game set should represent a pair of opposing crews of fighters; each able to hold ground against any other duelist.  

== Para-time Universe =
The game will expand to use the Morfiuthelas and other conventions found in the Role-playing game setting of Mai Appollonia Yo!  Specifically there will be introduction of magic, anachronistic devices, and doppelgangers.
