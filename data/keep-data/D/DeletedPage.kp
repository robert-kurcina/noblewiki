When the page starts with a link to DeletedPage, it is considered
"marked for deletion", and will eventually be expired.  Pages are
marked for deletion when they are off-topic.  If you believe that
a page has been erroneously marked for deletion, remove the tag
again and change the page such that it is more obvious why it is
on-topic.

Thanks.  Help keep this wiki on-topic: Testing is allowed, but
the topic of this wiki is the documentation of the Usemod wiki
engine.  Mark test pages for deletion yourself, now that you
know how to do it.
