A Web Browser programming language designed to enhance user experience.  Without JavaScript, all actions on a Web page that is to present dynamic information must make a round-trip call to the CGI code on the server.  JavaScript is used principally to manage forms validation, but many other subtle additions to a user experience can be had.  A key example is the ImageGallery.  The major script libraries used in the NobleWiki are as follows:

* jQuery - the base-line scripting libary that allows for cross-platform/cross-browser support.
* UFO - Unobtrusive Flash Object; allows embedding of Flash SWFs and graceful error notification in case the Flash player version is wrong.
* LightBox - Allows for the behavior of the ImageGallery.
