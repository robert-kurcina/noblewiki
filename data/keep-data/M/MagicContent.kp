These type of pages have a special directive added to it that will be processed by the wiki engine to create unique content derived from one or more external modules.  For example, the ListOfWantedPages is essentially a blank page except for a single magic content directive.  Magic content can of also share a page with normal wiki content, as can be seen in the MagicDiscussion and MagicCalendar commands.
<toc>
== Syntax and Invocation =
The way to invoke a magic content command is to specify at the very top of the page the following pattern:

<pre>
#MAGIC [@position] command [key=value key=value ...]
</pre>

An example specification that will invoke the <tt><nowiki>AllPages</nowiki></tt> command and place a list of pages above the wiki page's content.  The key/value pair <tt>list=ol</tt> informs the command to show the list as a numbered ordered list.

<pre>
#MAGIC @top AllPages list=ol
</pre>

The wiki engine will not display the magic content during a preview request while editing a page.  Magic content will display only after a page has been saved.

== Single Process Request =
The <tt>#MAGIC</tt> directive may appear only once and as the first line of a wiki page. Only the first directive is processed; all of the others are ignored.  

== Position Attribute =
The @position attribute is optional and by default is interpreted to be <tt>'bottom'</tt>.
