== Game Goal =
Players wage combat upon a battlefield comprised of multi-hex tiles with forces purchased from among the various types available in attempts to achieve victory in a “historical” mission or a selected free-form scenario.  Units are purchased via “Order-of-Battle” points [ OP ] and range from the light but versatile “Infantry” unit to the more devastating 
“Atomic Robots”.  Each unit type has a matching “Information card” that details the special abilities that the unit is capable of.  These abilities alter the basic rules of game play to provide for more interesting battlefield interactions.

Objective Markers are also placed upon the battlefield as goals for acquisition during play which translate into victory points.  Victory points are also awarded for eliminating enemy units.  At the end of the game – usually 6 turns long – the player with the most points wins!

== The Operational Art of War =
This game is a fanciful but detailed look at how to prosecute warfare at the “operational level”.  Unlike many such games that employ hundreds of unit counters to recreate such a simulation, this one focuses on the interaction of ten or twenty.  

=== EPIC GAMES =
Here are the key differences of operational level games when compared to “tactical level” games that deal with smaller units like men, squads, or platoons:

==== Game Scale =
This operational level game deals with units that are companies and battalions.  There’s about a thousand soldiers or one-hundred vehicles in a battalion.  Or, maybe it just contains 10 really humongous robots and their nervous human handlers.  

Operational level games are epic; with just a few units, these games simulate what would normally take hundreds of pieces in smaller scale games.  With this scale; battles can be waged over control of a city and its country-sides instead of just individual buildings or bridges.

==== Zone-of-Control [ ZOC ] =
Imagine reaching out your hands in front of you, and whirling about to cover your back.  You probably could cover about 3 feet in a radius around you; anybody coming within range would probably get smacked, or at least move cautiously by.  Now do this with a machine gun, with mortars, with cannons, with giant robot beam weapons.  And then, multiply that by several hundred or several thousand rounds of weapons fire by nearly as many soldiers or tanks covering several hundred meters all about.  That’s Zone-of-Control.

==== Supply =
In the scale of tactical level games, the firefights go pretty quickly; maybe five to twenty minutes pass in game-time depending on the scale of the simulation.  Ammo does run out, but probably not fuel.  You can always reload.  In operation level games, supply is critical.  Being “in supply” - within the distance of the supply truck convoys – can be the difference between having your units perforated, running for cover, or pressing the battle-line victoriously forward.

==== Line-of-Command [ LOC ] =
At the tactical level, the heroic commanders could probably shout orders to their equally heroic underlings, and maybe get some things done by all as a team.  It doesn’t work that well with the units that are way across the hill, especially when each unit represents the average response of possibly hundreds of disorganized warriors awaiting instruction.  Without Line-of-Command, units will not be able to participate in the glory of taking down that mammoth tank or draw the line against the rogue sentinel robot together.

==== Weather =
Lastly, weather conditions become a grave concern for the force commanders in operational-level play.  At smaller scales, it may rain or snow for the duration of the battle.  Perhaps the mud conditions might prevail through-out.  However, at this larger scale; the mud may clear up as soon as day breaks.  The time to make an opportune strike can be seen just a few hours away; hold that battle-line until then!
