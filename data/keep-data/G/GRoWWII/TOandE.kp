<blockquote>Consider that 1 Operational Point [ OP ] is equivalent to about	100 soldiers.  A standard 5 OP unit like the Biluxi Regulars then represent about 500 soldiers.  Keep this in mind when seeing the very end of this document that the Allied Supreme Headquarters governs about 100,000 OP. That's about 10 million soldiers across approximately 2,000 divisions from all nations in the Allied powers [ USA, USSR, UK, plus minor nations ].</blockquote>

Otherwise known as TOEs or TO&Es; these were blueprints used by each nations logistical and strategy experts to create new units and budget for training and technology.  Even within a nation the various branches could have their own variations based upon combat or support philosophy.  For example; the USA Marine Corps uses 13-man squads while the Army uses 9-man squads, or even 6 for BMP vehicles.  This bubbles up through the battalion levels and higher; resulting in an average of 15,000 persons per Marine Infantry division versus 10,000 persons on average for an Army Infantry division.

== Construction =
Historically, the US used square elements while the European forces used triangular elements.  That means; 2 battalions forms 1 regiment, and then 2 regiments for 1 brigade, and 2 brigades form 1 division.  Etc.  In the world of GROWWII, things are quadratic because of the increased numbers of available soldiers and equipment. In addition there's an assumption that well-balanced forces will be constructed with an average of 1 support unit [ HQ, Supply, Signals ] for every 4 or so combat units.

Therefore, define regiments as 4 declared battalions.  These regiments are OP independent in order to allow grouping into divisions or brigades.  Create divisions by defining 4 regiments.  

Corps are then defined as 4 divisions, and Armies as 4 corps.  Army Groups are then 4 Armies.  Following Army Groups are Theater of Operations with 3-6 Army Groups apiece, and then Supreme Forces as defined by either the Axis or Allies; each of which have 3-6 Theaters depending on the year within the GROWWII world history.

== Orders of Battle =
All levels of organization could be configured with 3-6 sub-elements instead of the normal 4. Depending on the needs of strategic command; each sub-element could instead be 3-6 of the next level lower in order to fulfill special operations demands.  At all organizational levels International elements are allowed but are most likely the be represented within the Army Groups from an administrative perspective. From a mission construction perspective; divisions, brigades, regiments, and battalions will appear from various international parent elements according to the conditions of environment and the period represented.

== Corps Organization Roles =
Not all Corps have combat mission roles; as a result their sub-elements will have different emphasis missions, and the parent Army and Army Groups will also vary as a result of aggregation.

There are four broad categories of roles; Combat Mission, Service Missions, Support Missions, and Base Missions.  The first two are near the battlefront and are separated by perhaps 100 miles.  Support Missions are usually out of the combat zones, but Base Missions are always at established cities of national origin. Below are a list of possible missions and roles for a wide variety of corps, followed by example names of corps.

== Pseudo-historical Details =
From a history-building perspective; these kinds configurations can be used in
various numbers to be doctrinal, uncommon, or rare assignments.  Regardless;
when a configuration is defined it can be named and cited with full illustrative
examples and force anaylsis for puff pieces.  That's a goal.  For example: 

=== Allohistorical LADs =
<i>The "Robotic Assault Regiment" first became established with the wide-spread production of the Halen Assault robot, which was not possible until the creation of the positronic neural-net at Harvard University in 1941. The regiment had multiple configurations including a couple with greater presence of infantry companies in order to hold ground. It was then determined that the best mission for which this type of regiment could be employed was those of Search and Destroy.  As such, great amounts of firepower - regardless of speed of approach - was desired. In 1944, the first of what became known as the "Loer Automated Destroyers [ LADs ]" became deployed at Gibraltar, Spain. They proved entirely successful	in weeding out remnant Axis pockets in short order. See FIGURE 30A and 30B for the	most common configurations. FIGURE 30C shows how the LADs were organized into the standard Brute Assault Corps.  The most famous of the LAD implementations was the 5th LAD Regiment, 2nd Mechanized Division of the 10th Armored Corps. Equally famous was the 23rd LAD Rgt of the	3/10 AC.</i>

== Leader Assignment =
Once the various divisions are configured can assign specific leaders to each of the divisions. The rules as of version 0.43.2 allow 1 leader per regiment and 1 more per 50 OP. The application of this should be conservative in order to keep leader ranks consistent between divisions.

Therefore apply this to the division:
 4 x 1-star [ 1 per regiment ]
 1 x 2-star [ 1 per the division ]
 
 1 x 2-star [ if 150 OP or more ]
 1 x 3-star [ if 200 OP or more ]
 1 x 2-star [ if 250 OP or more ]

To round things out, assign a 4-star leader to the corps but associate it with the division that has the most OP in support units, or preferably a division that is mechanized or wing.

 3-star Leaders may control a Division; it could be shared by 2 2-star Leaders
 4-star Leaders will control a Corps
 5-star Leaders will control an Army
 6-star Leaders will control an Army Group
 7-star Leaders will control a Theater of Operations
 8-star Leaders will control a Supreme Forces

== Decorated Units =
Lastly, we can create Insignia bonuses to map out to very specific implementations of a division configuration.  These bonuses should be between at most 2 insignia per regiment within one division of a given corps.  Each bonus will increase the OP value of the overal division by 1-3 OP and should come from a restricted list.

== Sample TOEs =
These are various seed examples of TO & E for a possible direction that combat units for the USA can be modeled.

=== Regimental TOEs =
Regiments are 4 battalions.  Usually one or two of the battalions of the four are unique or specialized.  For example, 3 of the battalions could be combat-oriented and the third would be a support unit.  This sort of variety ensures that the regiment is robust enough for incorporation into the larger division formations.  Regiments are lead by a 1-star Leader.  The total Operational Points [ OP ] value of a regiment can vary greatly; ranging from 20 OP for the typical infantry regiment to over 100 OP for a heavy armored assault regiment as the one shown below.

=== Corps Organization =
A Corps is the largest unit that can be represented by one "core game set" issued for GROWWII game kit since one kit will have 72 battalion counters - the number for an average-sized corps formation comprised of 4 divisions of 16 battalions each.  Corps are lead by a 4-star Leader and have 4-6 divisions; each of those lead by a 3-star Leader. The total value of a corps is dependent on how its divisions are formed, with each division comprised of 4 regiments or 16 battalions.  The average total could be said to be about 1000 OP and 64 battalions.

In the chart below is a sample Order-of-Battle [ OOB ] for an implementation of the standard TO&E template for a corps formation.  This unit is the 10th Armored Corps, and has in total 983 OP, 80 battalions arranged into 5 divisions.  There are a total of 33 Leaders.

  Insignia [ +5 OP ]
   One of the Robotic Assault Regiments of the 2nd Mechanized Division is
   the highly-decorated 5th LAD Regiment. Two of the units within receive
   Insignia with these effects according to the unit type boosted:
      
   RBT - Orum Slaughter Bots; receives Agile 1
   RBT - Halen Assault Ballistar; receives +2 MOV
   WPN - Garfield Rocket Platform; receives Heavy Metal 2
 
 
=== Army Group =
This is an example of an Army Group.  An Army group contains 4-6 Armies totaling about 100 divisions or 5000 OP. At this level, the Army Group can contain armies belonging to other nations.  Any Army Group is commanded by a 6-star Leader with a subordinate 5-star Leader for each Army beneath.  Each Army is then comprised of 4-7 Corps serving a variety of roles [ see above ].  The totals for an Army then is around 1000 OP and about 300 battalions; roughly 20 divisions.  Each Corps is lead by a 5-star Leader.

=== Supreme Forces =
The Allies have a single Supreme Forces structure that encompasses all of the allied nations.  This is led by an 8-star Leader with subordinate 7-star Leaders at a rate of one per Operations Theater reporting.  The total for each Supreme Force is about 2000 divisions or roughly 100,000 OP.  Each Operations Theater forces totals 500 divisions and around 20,000 OP.  These are each comprised of 4-6 Army Groups; each lead by a 6-star Leader.

These are various seed examples of TO & E for a possible direction that combat units for the USA can be modeled.

=== Regimental TOEs =
Regiments are 4 battalions.  Usually one or two of the battalions of the four are unique or specialized.  For example, 3 of the battalions could be combat-oriented and the third would be a support unit.  This sort of variety ensures that the regiment is robust enough for incorporation into the larger division formations.  Regiments are lead by a 1-star Leader.  The total Operational Points [ OP ] value of a regiment can vary greatly; ranging from 20 OP for the typical infantry regiment to over 100 OP for a heavy armored assault regiment as the one shown below.

=== Corps Organization =
A Corps is the largest unit that can be represented by one "core game set" issued for GROWWII game kit since one kit will have 72 battalion counters - the number for an average-sized corps formation comprised of 4 divisions of 16 battalions each.  Corps are lead by a 4-star Leader and have 4-6 divisions; each of those lead by a 3-star Leader. The total value of a corps is dependent on how its divisions are formed, with each division comprised of 4 regiments or 16 battalions.  The average total could be said to be about 1000 OP and 64 battalions.

In the chart below is a sample Order-of-Battle [ OOB ] for an implementation of the standard TO&E template for a corps formation.  This unit is the 10th Armored Corps, and has in total 983 OP, 80 battalions arranged into 5 divisions.  There are a total of 33 Leaders.

=== Army Group =
This is an example of an Army Group.  An Army group contains 4-6 Armies totaling about 100 divisions or 5000 OP. At this level, the Army Group can contain armies belonging to other nations.  Any Army Group is commanded by a 6-star Leader with a subordinate 5-star Leader for each Army beneath.  Each Army is then comprised of 4-7 Corps serving a variety of roles [ see above ].  The totals for an Army then is around 1000 OP and about 300 battalions; roughly 20 divisions.  Each Corps is lead by a 5-star Leader.

<blockquote>Consider that 1 Operational Point [ OP ] is equivalent to about	100 soldiers.  A standard 5 OP unit like the Biluxi Regulars then represent about 500 soldiers.  Keep this in mind when seeing the very end of this document that the Allied Supreme Headquarters governs about 100,000 OP. That's about 10 million soldiers across approximately 2,000 divisions from all nations in the Allied powers [ USA, USSR, UK, plus minor nations ].</blockquote>
<toc 200>

Otherwise known as TOEs or TO&Es; these were blueprints used by each nations logistical and strategy experts to create new units and budget for training and technology.  Even within a nation the various branches could have their own variations based upon combat or support philosophy.  For example; the USA Marine Corps uses 13-man squads while the Army uses 9-man squads, or even 6 for BMP vehicles.  This bubbles up through the battalion levels and higher; resulting in an average of 15,000 persons per Marine Infantry division versus 10,000 persons on average for an Army Infantry division.

== Construction =
Historically, the US used square elements while the European forces used triangular elements.  That means; 2 battalions forms 1 regiment, and then 2 regiments for 1 brigade, and 2 brigades form 1 division.  Etc.  In the world of GROWWII, things are quadratic because of the increased numbers of available soldiers and equipment. In addition there's an assumption that well-balanced forces will be constructed with an average of 1 support unit [ HQ, Supply, Signals ] for every 4 or so combat units.

Therefore, define regiments as 4 declared battalions.  These regiments are OP independent in order to allow grouping into divisions or brigades.  Create divisions by defining 4 regiments.  

Corps are then defined as 4 divisions, and Armies as 4 corps.  Army Groups are then 4 Armies.  Following Army Groups are Theater of Operations with 3-6 Army Groups apiece, and then Supreme Forces as defined by either the Axis or Allies; each of which have 3-6 Theaters depending on the year within the GROWWII world history.

== Orders of Battle =
All levels of organization could be configured with 3-6 sub-elements instead of the normal 4. Depending on the needs of strategic command; each sub-element could instead be 3-6 of the next level lower in order to fulfill special operations demands.  At all organizational levels International elements are allowed but are most likely the be represented within the Army Groups from an administrative perspective. From a mission construction perspective; divisions, brigades, regiments, and battalions will appear from various international parent elements according to the conditions of environment and the period represented.

== Corps Organization Roles =
Not all Corps have combat mission roles; as a result their sub-elements will have different emphasis missions, and the parent Army and Army Groups will also vary as a result of aggregation.

There are four broad categories of roles; Combat Mission, Service Missions, Support Missions, and Base Missions.  The first two are near the battlefront and are separated by perhaps 100 miles.  Support Missions are usually out of the combat zones, but Base Missions are always at established cities of national origin. Below are a list of possible missions and roles for a wide variety of corps, followed by example names of corps.

== Pseudo-historical Details =
From a history-building perspective; these kinds configurations can be used in
various numbers to be doctrinal, uncommon, or rare assignments.  Regardless;
when a configuration is defined it can be named and cited with full illustrative
examples and force anaylsis for puff pieces.  That's a goal.  For example: 

=== Allohistorical LADs =
<i>The "Robotic Assault Regiment" first became established with the wide-spread production of the Halen Assault robot, which was not possible until the creation of the positronic neural-net at Harvard University in 1941. The regiment had multiple configurations including a couple with greater presence of infantry companies in order to hold ground. It was then determined that the best mission for which this type of regiment could be employed was those of Search and Destroy.  As such, great amounts of firepower - regardless of speed of approach - was desired. In 1944, the first of what became known as the "Loer Automated Destroyers [ LADs ]" became deployed at Gibraltar, Spain. They proved entirely successful	in weeding out remnant Axis pockets in short order. See FIGURE 30A and 30B for the	most common configurations. FIGURE 30C shows how the LADs were organized into the standard Brute Assault Corps.  The most famous of the LAD implementations was the 5th LAD Regiment, 2nd Mechanized Division of the 10th Armored Corps. Equally famous was the 23rd LAD Rgt of the	3/10 AC.</i>

== Leader Assignment =
Once the various divisions are configured can assign specific leaders to each of the divisions. The rules as of version 0.43.2 allow 1 leader per regiment and 1 more per 50 OP. The application of this should be conservative in order to keep leader ranks consistent between divisions.

Therefore apply this to the division:
 4 x 1-star [ 1 per regiment ]
 1 x 2-star [ 1 per the division ]
 
 1 x 2-star [ if 150 OP or more ]
 1 x 3-star [ if 200 OP or more ]
 1 x 2-star [ if 250 OP or more ]

To round things out, assign a 4-star leader to the corps but associate it with the division that has the most OP in support units, or preferably a division that is mechanized or wing.

 3-star Leaders may control a Division; it could be shared by 2 2-star Leaders
 4-star Leaders will control a Corps
 5-star Leaders will control an Army
 6-star Leaders will control an Army Group
 7-star Leaders will control a Theater of Operations
 8-star Leaders will control a Supreme Forces

== Decorated Units =
Lastly, we can create Insignia bonuses to map out to very specific implementations of a division configuration.  These bonuses should be between at most 2 insignia per regiment within one division of a given corps.  Each bonus will increase the OP value of the overal division by 1-3 OP and should come from a restricted list.

== Sample TOEs =
These are various seed examples of TO & E for a possible direction that combat units for the USA can be modeled.

=== Regimental TOEs =
Regiments are 4 battalions.  Usually one or two of the battalions of the four are unique or specialized.  For example, 3 of the battalions could be combat-oriented and the third would be a support unit.  This sort of variety ensures that the regiment is robust enough for incorporation into the larger division formations.  Regiments are lead by a 1-star Leader.  The total Operational Points [ OP ] value of a regiment can vary greatly; ranging from 20 OP for the typical infantry regiment to over 100 OP for a heavy armored assault regiment as the one shown below.
