Lists are powerful ways of presenting information.  Lists are either <tt>bulleted</tt>, <tt>numbered</tt>, or are <tt>definition</tt> lists.

=== Bulleted Lists ===
You create bulleted lists by using an "*" asterisk as the first character on a line.  Use multiple asterisks in a row to further indent the list.

<b>For example:</b>
* bullets
** indented bullets
*** indented bullets
The above was created using this syntax:
<pre>
* bullets
** indented bullets
*** indented bullets
</pre>

=== Number Lists ===
You can create numbered lists by using a "#" hashmark as the first character on each line.  The numbering will increment according to the size of the list of lines.  Use multiple hashmarks in a row to further indent the list.

<b>For example:</b>
# numbered list
## indented list
### depth 3 indented list
### more
## and more
The above was created using this syntax:
<pre>
# numbered list
## indented list
### depth 3 indented list
### more
## and more
# and more
</pre>

=== Definition Lists ===
A definition list can be created by placing a ";" semicolon as the first character on a line, and using a ":" colon to separate the term from the definition. The colon must be on the same line as the semicolon; Definitions can be indented by repeated use of the ";" semicolon.

<b>For example:</b>
;Term:Definition
;Verse:The owl and the pussy cat went to sea
;;Indented Term:Definition of an indented term
The above was created using this syntax:
<pre>
;Term:Definition
;Verse:The owl and the pussy cat went to sea
;;Indented Term:Definition of an indented term
