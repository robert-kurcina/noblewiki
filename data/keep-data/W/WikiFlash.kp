Any number of Flash SWF files may be displayed within a page if they exists within the uploads directory. Ideally, the dimensions of the SWF file as it appears in each instance within a page is limited to at most 400 pixels wide by 300 pixels. tall.  Exceeding these dimensions is not allowed.

If a SWF file is of importance or great curiosity, it should be placed upon a page by itself using the Magic Content directive.  As such, the page will not have a preview feature; it must be saved in order to render the results.  Here's an example of how the syntax would appear:

To help organize Flash content, place any new MagicFlash pages under FlashSWF.  Non-<nowiki>MagicFlash</nowiki> SWF content can be placed anywhere, but should be linked from the master page as well.
