== How to Contribute =
There are several parallel projects in development.  Contribute to one or more projects later; pick a single project for now and focus on one or more of its tasks.  For example, for the [GRoWWII Giant Robots of World War II] project there's need for history, [GRoWWII/TOandE Tables of Organization and Equipment], and rules documentation.
