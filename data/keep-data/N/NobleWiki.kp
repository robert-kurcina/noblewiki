== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.03] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.

== Features =
This version of the <nowiki>UseMod</nowiki>wiki engine is highly customized, and adds the following features not available in the standard wiki.pl. 

!!Difference&nbsp;Things!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>~~~</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>~~~~</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Flash</nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki><toc NNN></nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Discuss</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||

== Possible Patches =
!!Patches Under Consideration!!Description!!
||UseMod:WikiPatches/EmbeddedBacklinks|class=first|width=300||want||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/NoAnonyms||need; should prevent spammers||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/SurgeProtector||want, unsure if useful||

=== Broken Things =
Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>~~~</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>~~~~</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Flash</nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki><toc NNN></nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Discuss</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||

=== Code-related Features =
These items I think I'll need to complete before I submit the code to SourceForge.

!!Features Planned|width=200!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||

||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Flash</nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki><toc NNN></nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Discuss</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||

Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

=== Planned Things =
Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!Features Planned!!Description!!
||<tt><nowiki>{{history|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create a timeline using the Timeline javascript widget||
||<tt><nowiki>{{section|WikiPage|header}}</nowiki></tt>||Non-recursively insert the section text for any page of the identified TOC header||
||<tt><nowiki>{{comments}}</nowiki></tt>||Allow comments to be added if inserted at bottom of page.  Comments would be a separate file structure and accessed via a new tab and input would be GUI-based instead of using the Edit-box. Uses sub-pages named as <tt><nowiki>/CommentsPage</nowiki></tt> or <tt><nowiki>/CommentsSubPage</nowiki></tt>.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{CSS|media|stylesheet}}</nowiki></tt>||Added at top of an editor's home-page to alter CSS used before rendering any wiki page.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{feedback|template}}</nowiki></tt>||Use a template [ see above ] to capture feedback or voting information||
||<tt><nowiki>{{columns|color}}</nowiki></tt>||Sort of like the version use on en.wikipedia.org; specify that content following appears in one, two, or three columns.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{graph|type|dimension}}</nowiki></tt>||Add support for javascript-generated graphs.  Bar graphs, line graphs, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{data|id}}</nowiki></tt>||Add dataset storage in two phases.  Phase I is JSON creation for reference by SWFs, and <tt><nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki></tt> libraries.  Phase II is a read/write API possibly via <tt><nowiki>XmlHttpSocket</nowiki></tt> for AJAX or SWF.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{code|syntax}}</nowiki></tt>||Add syntax highlighting for common language files like perl, actionscript, javascript, css, xml, and html. The output will be contained within <tt><nowiki><code class='syntax'></code></nowiki></tt> blocks and dynamically higlighted using javascript.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{whiteboard|shared}}</nowiki></tt>||Create sketches using Flash, and store the output as a bitmap on the server, and the curves as JSON elements.||

=== Code-related Features =
These items I think I'll need to complete before I submit the code to [http://www.sourceforge.net SourceForge]

!!Features Planned|width=200!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.03] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =
This version of the <nowiki>UseMod</nowiki>wiki engine is highly customized, and adds the following features not available in the standard wiki.pl. 

!!Difference&nbsp;Things!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||

If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Flash</nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki><toc NNN></nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Discuss</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||

== Possible Patches =
!!Patches Under Consideration!!Description!!
||UseMod:WikiPatches/EmbeddedBacklinks|class=first|width=300||want||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/NoAnonyms||need; should prevent spammers||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/SurgeProtector||want, unsure if useful||

=== Broken Things =
Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

=== Planned Things =
Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!Features Planned!!Description!!
||<tt><nowiki>{{history|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create a timeline using the Timeline javascript widget||
||<tt><nowiki>{{section|WikiPage|header}}</nowiki></tt>||Non-recursively insert the section text for any page of the identified TOC header||
||<tt><nowiki>{{CSS|media|stylesheet}}</nowiki></tt>||Added at top of an editor's home-page to alter CSS used before rendering any wiki page.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{feedback|template}}</nowiki></tt>||Use a template [ see above ] to capture feedback or voting information||
||<tt><nowiki>{{columns|color}}</nowiki></tt>||Sort of like the version use on en.wikipedia.org; specify that content following appears in one, two, or three columns.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{graph|type|dimension}}</nowiki></tt>||Add support for javascript-generated graphs.  Bar graphs, line graphs, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{data|id}}</nowiki></tt>||Add dataset storage in two phases.  Phase I is JSON creation for reference by SWFs, and <tt><nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki></tt> libraries.  Phase II is a read/write API possibly via <tt><nowiki>XmlHttpSocket</nowiki></tt> for AJAX or SWF.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{whiteboard|shared}}</nowiki></tt>||Create sketches using Flash, and store the output as a bitmap on the server, and the curves as JSON elements.||

=== Code-related Features =
These items I think I'll need to complete before I submit the code to [http://www.sourceforge.net SourceForge]

!!Features Planned|width=200!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =

!!Difference&nbsp;Things!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||

||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||

||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki><toc NNN></nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Discuss</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.  All [LocalWiki:WikiStyleGuide sub-pages] must conform to the WikiWord pattern on both sides of the slash; i.e.; <tt><nowiki>PrimaryPage/SubPage</nowiki></tt> instead of just <tt><nowiki>PrimaryPage/Word</nowiki></tt>||

== Possible Patches =
!!Patches Under Consideration!!Description!!
||UseMod:WikiPatches/EmbeddedBacklinks|class=first|width=300||want||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/NoAnonyms||need; should prevent spammers||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/SurgeProtector||want, unsure if useful||

=== Broken Things =
Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

=== Planned Things =
Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!Features Planned!!Description!!
||<tt><nowiki>{{history|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create a timeline using the Timeline javascript widget||
||<tt><nowiki>{{section|WikiPage|header}}</nowiki></tt>||Non-recursively insert the section text for any page of the identified TOC header||
||<tt><nowiki>{{CSS|media|stylesheet}}</nowiki></tt>||Added at top of an editor's home-page to alter CSS used before rendering any wiki page.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{feedback|template}}</nowiki></tt>||Use a template [ see above ] to capture feedback or voting information||
||<tt><nowiki>{{columns|color}}</nowiki></tt>||Sort of like the version use on en.wikipedia.org; specify that content following appears in one, two, or three columns.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{graph|type|dimension}}</nowiki></tt>||Add support for javascript-generated graphs.  Bar graphs, line graphs, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{data|id}}</nowiki></tt>||Add dataset storage in two phases.  Phase I is JSON creation for reference by SWFs, and <tt><nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki></tt> libraries.  Phase II is a read/write API possibly via <tt><nowiki>XmlHttpSocket</nowiki></tt> for AJAX or SWF.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{whiteboard|shared}}</nowiki></tt>||Create sketches using Flash, and store the output as a bitmap on the server, and the curves as JSON elements.||

=== Code-related Features =
These items I think I'll need to complete before I submit the code to [http://www.sourceforge.net SourceForge]

!!Features Planned|width=200!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =
This version of the <nowiki>UseMod</nowiki>wiki engine is highly customized, and adds the following features not available in the standard wiki.pl. 

!!Difference&nbsp;Things!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>~~~</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>$$$$</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Flash</nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||

||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki><toc NNN></nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Discuss</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||

These are the patches that have been applied:
!!Patches Applied!!Description!!
||UseMod:WikiPatches/AnchorsInFreeLinkBugFix|class=first|width=300||Corrects how [LocalWiki:WikiURLs#freelinks FreeLinks] appear||

||UseMod:WikiPatches/NoAnonyms||need; should prevent spammers||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/SurgeProtector||want, unsure if useful||

=== Broken Things =
Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

=== Planned Things =
Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!Features Planned!!Description!!
||<tt><nowiki>{{history|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create a timeline using the Timeline javascript widget||
||<tt><nowiki>{{section|WikiPage|header}}</nowiki></tt>||Non-recursively insert the section text for any page of the identified TOC header||
||<tt><nowiki>{{CSS|media|stylesheet}}</nowiki></tt>||Added at top of an editor's home-page to alter CSS used before rendering any wiki page.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{feedback|template}}</nowiki></tt>||Use a template [ see above ] to capture feedback or voting information||
||<tt><nowiki>{{columns|color}}</nowiki></tt>||Sort of like the version use on en.wikipedia.org; specify that content following appears in one, two, or three columns.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{graph|type|dimension}}</nowiki></tt>||Add support for javascript-generated graphs.  Bar graphs, line graphs, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{data|id}}</nowiki></tt>||Add dataset storage in two phases.  Phase I is JSON creation for reference by SWFs, and <tt><nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki></tt> libraries.  Phase II is a read/write API possibly via <tt><nowiki>XmlHttpSocket</nowiki></tt> for AJAX or SWF.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{whiteboard|shared}}</nowiki></tt>||Create sketches using Flash, and store the output as a bitmap on the server, and the curves as JSON elements.||

=== Code-related Features =
These items I think I'll need to complete before I submit the code to [http://www.sourceforge.net SourceForge]

!!Features Planned|width=200!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||
||GMT Offset Detection||This could be done via JavaScript and passed automatically to the CGI whenever a page is edited.  Of course, also preset this in the Preferences page as well.||

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =

!!Difference&nbsp;Things!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||

||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki><toc NNN></nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Discuss</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||

||UseMod:WikiPatches/NoAnonyms||need; should prevent spammers||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/SurgeProtector||want, unsure if useful||

=== Broken Things =
Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

=== Planned Things =
Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!Features Planned!!Description!!
||<tt><nowiki>{{history|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create a timeline using the Timeline javascript widget||
||<tt><nowiki>{{section|WikiPage|header}}</nowiki></tt>||Non-recursively insert the section text for any page of the identified TOC header||
||<tt><nowiki>{{CSS|media|stylesheet}}</nowiki></tt>||Added at top of an editor's home-page to alter CSS used before rendering any wiki page.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{feedback|template}}</nowiki></tt>||Use a template [ see above ] to capture feedback or voting information||
||<tt><nowiki>{{columns|color}}</nowiki></tt>||Sort of like the version use on en.wikipedia.org; specify that content following appears in one, two, or three columns.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{graph|type|dimension}}</nowiki></tt>||Add support for javascript-generated graphs.  Bar graphs, line graphs, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{data|id}}</nowiki></tt>||Add dataset storage in two phases.  Phase I is JSON creation for reference by SWFs, and <tt><nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki></tt> libraries.  Phase II is a read/write API possibly via <tt><nowiki>XmlHttpSocket</nowiki></tt> for AJAX or SWF.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||

=== Code-related Features =
These items I think I'll need to complete before I submit the code to [http://www.sourceforge.net SourceForge]

!!Features Planned|width=200!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||
||GMT Offset Detection||This could be done via JavaScript and passed automatically to the CGI whenever a page is edited.  Of course, also preset this in the Preferences page as well.||

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =
This version of the <nowiki>UseMod</nowiki>wiki engine is highly customized, and adds the following features not available in the standard wiki.pl. 

!!Difference&nbsp;Things!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>~~~</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>$$$$</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Flash</nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||

||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki><toc NNN></nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Discuss</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||

Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

=== Planned Things =
Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!Features Planned!!Description!!
||<tt><nowiki>{{history|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create a timeline using the Timeline javascript widget||
||<tt><nowiki>{{section|WikiPage|header}}</nowiki></tt>||Non-recursively insert the section text for any page of the identified TOC header||
||<tt><nowiki>{{CSS|media|stylesheet}}</nowiki></tt>||Added at top of an editor's home-page to alter CSS used before rendering any wiki page.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{feedback|template}}</nowiki></tt>||Use a template [ see above ] to capture feedback or voting information||
||<tt><nowiki>{{columns|color}}</nowiki></tt>||Sort of like the version use on en.wikipedia.org; specify that content following appears in one, two, or three columns.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{graph|type|dimension}}</nowiki></tt>||Add support for javascript-generated graphs.  Bar graphs, line graphs, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{data|id}}</nowiki></tt>||Add dataset storage in two phases.  Phase I is JSON creation for reference by SWFs, and <tt><nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki></tt> libraries.  Phase II is a read/write API possibly via <tt><nowiki>XmlHttpSocket</nowiki></tt> for AJAX or SWF.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||

!!Features Planned|width=200!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||
||GMT Offset Detection||This could be done via JavaScript and passed automatically to the CGI whenever a page is edited.  Of course, also preset this in the Preferences page as well.||

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =
This version of the <nowiki>UseMod</nowiki>wiki engine is highly customized, and adds the following features not available in the standard wiki.pl. 

!!Difference&nbsp;Things!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>~~~</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>$$$$</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||

If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Flash</nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||

||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Flash</nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki><toc NNN></nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Discuss</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||

Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

=== Planned Things =
Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!Features Planned!!Description!!
||<tt><nowiki>{{history|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create a timeline using the Timeline javascript widget||
||<tt><nowiki>{{section|WikiPage|header}}</nowiki></tt>||Non-recursively insert the section text for any page of the identified TOC header||

||<tt><nowiki>{{graph|type|dimension}}</nowiki></tt>||Add support for javascript-generated graphs.  Bar graphs, line graphs, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{data|id}}</nowiki></tt>||Add dataset storage in two phases.  Phase I is JSON creation for reference by SWFs, and <tt><nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki></tt> libraries.  Phase II is a read/write API possibly via <tt><nowiki>XmlHttpSocket</nowiki></tt> for AJAX or SWF.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||

!!Features Planned|width=200!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =
This version of the <nowiki>UseMod</nowiki>wiki engine is highly customized, and adds the following features not available in the standard wiki.pl. 

!!Difference&nbsp;Things!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>~~~</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>$$$$</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.

If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||

The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Flash</nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki>{{toc NNN}}</nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Discuss</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||

Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

=== Planned Things =
Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!Features Planned!!Description!!
||<tt><nowiki>{{history|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create a timeline using the Timeline javascript widget||
||<tt><nowiki>{{section|WikiPage|header}}</nowiki></tt>||Non-recursively insert the section text for any page of the identified TOC header||

||<tt><nowiki>{{graph|type|dimension}}</nowiki></tt>||Add support for javascript-generated graphs.  Bar graphs, line graphs, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{data|id}}</nowiki></tt>||Add dataset storage in two phases.  Phase I is JSON creation for reference by SWFs, and <tt><nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki></tt> libraries.  Phase II is a read/write API possibly via <tt><nowiki>XmlHttpSocket</nowiki></tt> for AJAX or SWF.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||

!!Features Planned|width=200!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =

!!Difference&nbsp;Things!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||

||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>~~~</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>$$$$</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Flash</nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki>{{toc NNN}}</nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>#MAGIC Discuss</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||
||Redirect to Edit Page||By setting action=referer in the <tt><nowiki>$NotFoundPage</nowiki></tt>, the hyperlink created will redirect to the edit page for the name of the page. This is useful to automatically generate edit requests for Notes pages.||

||UseMod:WikiPatches/SurgeProtector||want, unsure if useful||

=== Broken Things =
Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

=== Planned Things =
Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!Features Planned!!Description!!
||<tt><nowiki>{{history|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create a timeline using the Timeline javascript widget||
||<tt><nowiki>{{section|WikiPage|header}}</nowiki></tt>||Non-recursively insert the section text for any page of the identified TOC header||
||<tt><nowiki>{{CSS|media|stylesheet}}</nowiki></tt>||Added at top of an editor's home-page to alter CSS used before rendering any wiki page.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{feedback|template}}</nowiki></tt>||Use a template [ see above ] to capture feedback or voting information||
||<tt><nowiki>{{columns|color}}</nowiki></tt>||Sort of like the version use on en.wikipedia.org; specify that content following appears in one, two, or three columns.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{graph|type|dimension}}</nowiki></tt>||Add support for javascript-generated graphs.  Bar graphs, line graphs, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{data|id}}</nowiki></tt>||Add dataset storage in two phases.  Phase I is JSON creation for reference by SWFs, and <tt><nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki></tt> libraries.  Phase II is a read/write API possibly via <tt><nowiki>XmlHttpSocket</nowiki></tt> for AJAX or SWF.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||

=== Code-related Features =
These items I think I'll need to complete before I submit the code to [http://www.sourceforge.net SourceForge]

!!Features Planned|width=200!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||
||GMT Offset Detection||This could be done via JavaScript and passed automatically to the CGI whenever a page is edited.  Of course, also preset this in the Preferences page as well.||

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =

!!Difference&nbsp;Things!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||

||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>~~~</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>$$$$</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki>{{command: Flash}}</nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki>{{toc NNN}}</nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>{{command:  Discuss}}</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||
||Redirect to Edit Page||By setting action=referer in the <tt><nowiki>$NotFoundPage</nowiki></tt>, the hyperlink created will redirect to the edit page for the name of the page. This is useful to automatically generate edit requests for Notes pages.||

||UseMod:WikiPatches/SurgeProtector||want, unsure if useful||

=== Broken Things =
Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

=== Planned Things =
Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!Features Planned!!Description!!
||<tt><nowiki>{{history|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create a timeline using the Timeline javascript widget||
||<tt><nowiki>{{section|WikiPage|header}}</nowiki></tt>||Non-recursively insert the section text for any page of the identified TOC header||
||<tt><nowiki>{{CSS|media|stylesheet}}</nowiki></tt>||Added at top of an editor's home-page to alter CSS used before rendering any wiki page.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{feedback|template}}</nowiki></tt>||Use a template [ see above ] to capture feedback or voting information||
||<tt><nowiki>{{columns|color}}</nowiki></tt>||Sort of like the version use on en.wikipedia.org; specify that content following appears in one, two, or three columns.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{graph|type|dimension}}</nowiki></tt>||Add support for javascript-generated graphs.  Bar graphs, line graphs, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{data|id}}</nowiki></tt>||Add dataset storage in two phases.  Phase I is JSON creation for reference by SWFs, and <tt><nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki></tt> libraries.  Phase II is a read/write API possibly via <tt><nowiki>XmlHttpSocket</nowiki></tt> for AJAX or SWF.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||

!!Features Planned|width=200!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||
||GMT Offset Detection||This could be done via JavaScript and passed automatically to the CGI whenever a page is edited.  Of course, also preset this in the Preferences page as well.||

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =
This version of the <nowiki>UseMod</nowiki>wiki engine is highly customized, and adds the following features not available in the standard wiki.pl. 

!!Difference&nbsp;Things!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>~~~</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>$$$$</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki>{{command: Flash}}</nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki>{{toc NNN}}</nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>{{command:  Discuss}}</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||
||Redirect to Edit Page||By setting action=referer in the <tt><nowiki>$NotFoundPage</nowiki></tt>, the hyperlink created will redirect to the edit page for the name of the page. This is useful to automatically generate edit requests for Notes pages.||
||Block Colors||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{block:key=value|key=value|..}}</nowiki></tt> where key is bgcolor, color, or padding [in pixels].  bgcolor and color accept and standard CSS color names.||

== Patches Applied =
These are the patches that have been applied:

||UseMod:WikiPatches/PrivateUserGroups||Modified from original.  Each user name must be on it's own line and surrounded by curly braces like <tt><nowiki>{e:UserName} or {r:UserName}</nowiki></tt> to indicate can edit or can read.  Otherwise an Authorization Error page will appear [ AuthError ]||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/UserTalkSpace||Modified from original such that each page potentially has a 'Notes' page.  See NotesPages.||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/FooterNotes||Allows for plain-text citations.  See FootNotes page.||

== Possible Patches =
!!Patches Under Consideration!!Description!!
||UseMod:WikiPatches/EmbeddedBacklinks|class=first|width=300||want||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/NoAnonyms||need; should prevent spammers||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/SurgeProtector||want, unsure if useful||

=== Broken Things =
Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

=== Planned Things =
Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!Features Planned!!Description!!
||<tt><nowiki>{{history|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create a timeline using the Timeline javascript widget||
||<tt><nowiki>{{section|WikiPage|header}}</nowiki></tt>||Non-recursively insert the section text for any page of the identified TOC header||
||<tt><nowiki>{{CSS|media|stylesheet}}</nowiki></tt>||Added at top of an editor's home-page to alter CSS used before rendering any wiki page.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{feedback|template}}</nowiki></tt>||Use a template [ see above ] to capture feedback or voting information||
||<tt><nowiki>{{columns|color}}</nowiki></tt>||Sort of like the version use on en.wikipedia.org; specify that content following appears in one, two, or three columns.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{graph|type|dimension}}</nowiki></tt>||Add support for javascript-generated graphs.  Bar graphs, line graphs, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{data|id}}</nowiki></tt>||Add dataset storage in two phases.  Phase I is JSON creation for reference by SWFs, and <tt><nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki></tt> libraries.  Phase II is a read/write API possibly via <tt><nowiki>XmlHttpSocket</nowiki></tt> for AJAX or SWF.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{whiteboard|shared}}</nowiki></tt>||Create sketches using Flash, and store the output as a bitmap on the server, and the curves as JSON elements.||

=== Code-related Features =
These items I think I'll need to complete before I submit the code to [http://www.sourceforge.net SourceForge]

!!Features Planned|width=200!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||
||GMT Offset Detection||This could be done via JavaScript and passed automatically to the CGI whenever a page is edited.  Of course, also preset this in the Preferences page as well.||

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =
This version of the <nowiki>UseMod</nowiki>wiki engine is highly customized, and adds the following features not available in the standard wiki.pl. 

!!Difference&nbsp;Things!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>~~~</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>$$$$</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki>{{command: Flash}}</nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki>{{toc NNN}}</nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>{{command:  Discuss}}</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||
||Redirect to Edit Page||By setting action=referer in the <tt><nowiki>$NotFoundPage</nowiki></tt>, the hyperlink created will redirect to the edit page for the name of the page. This is useful to automatically generate edit requests for Notes pages.||
||Block Colors||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{block:key=value|key=value|..}}</nowiki></tt> where key is bgcolor, color, or padding [in pixels].  bgcolor and color accept and standard CSS color names.||

== Patches Applied =
These are the patches that have been applied:

||UseMod:WikiPatches/AutoMailto||Convert email addresses found into mailTo:<address>||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate||Modified to require a command string of <tt>{{template:</tt> before it can be used. Created instructions for use as well; see WikiTemplates||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/MagicContent||Added.  Need to create links to standard magic content pages||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/MagicWantedPages||Via [Wiki:WikiPatches/MagicContent MagicContent]; creates a list of pages that have not yet been created but are referenced by at least 1 existing page||

||UseMod:WikiPatches/SubPages||Modified syntax  <tt><nowiki>{{subpages}}</nowiki></tt>Inserts all of a page's sub-pages.  Optional page name as in <tt><nowiki>{{subpages:PageName}}</nowiki></tt> will show that page's subpages||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/PrivateUserGroups||Modified from original.  Each user name must be on it's own line and surrounded by curly braces like <tt><nowiki>{e:UserName} or {r:UserName}</nowiki></tt> to indicate can edit or can read.  Otherwise an Authorization Error page will appear [ AuthError ]||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/UserTalkSpace||Modified from original such that each page potentially has a 'Notes' page.  See NotesPages.||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/FooterNotes||Allows for plain-text citations.  See FootNotes page.||

== Possible Patches =
!!Patches Under Consideration!!Description!!
||UseMod:WikiPatches/EmbeddedBacklinks|class=first|width=300||want||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/NoAnonyms||need; should prevent spammers||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/SurgeProtector||want, unsure if useful||

=== Broken Things =
Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

=== Planned Things =
Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!Features Planned!!Description!!
||<tt><nowiki>{{history|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create a timeline using the Timeline javascript widget||
||<tt><nowiki>{{section|WikiPage|header}}</nowiki></tt>||Non-recursively insert the section text for any page of the identified TOC header||
||<tt><nowiki>{{CSS|media|stylesheet}}</nowiki></tt>||Added at top of an editor's home-page to alter CSS used before rendering any wiki page.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{feedback|template}}</nowiki></tt>||Use a template [ see above ] to capture feedback or voting information||
||<tt><nowiki>{{columns|color}}</nowiki></tt>||Sort of like the version use on en.wikipedia.org; specify that content following appears in one, two, or three columns.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{graph|type|dimension}}</nowiki></tt>||Add support for javascript-generated graphs.  Bar graphs, line graphs, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{data|id}}</nowiki></tt>||Add dataset storage in two phases.  Phase I is JSON creation for reference by SWFs, and <tt><nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki></tt> libraries.  Phase II is a read/write API possibly via <tt><nowiki>XmlHttpSocket</nowiki></tt> for AJAX or SWF.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{whiteboard|shared}}</nowiki></tt>||Create sketches using Flash, and store the output as a bitmap on the server, and the curves as JSON elements.||

=== Code-related Features =
These items I think I'll need to complete before I submit the code to [http://www.sourceforge.net SourceForge]

!!Features Planned|width=200!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||
||GMT Offset Detection||This could be done via JavaScript and passed automatically to the CGI whenever a page is edited.  Of course, also preset this in the Preferences page as well.||

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =
This version of the <nowiki>UseMod</nowiki>wiki engine is highly customized, and adds the following features not available in the standard wiki.pl. 

!!Difference&nbsp;Things!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>~~~</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>$$$$</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki>{{command: Flash}}</nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki>{{toc NNN}}</nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>{{command:  Discuss}}</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||
||Redirect to Edit Page||By setting action=referer in the <tt><nowiki>$NotFoundPage</nowiki></tt>, the hyperlink created will redirect to the edit page for the name of the page. This is useful to automatically generate edit requests for Notes pages.||
||Block Colors||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{block:key=value|key=value|..}}</nowiki></tt> where key is bgcolor, color, or padding [in pixels].  bgcolor and color accept and standard CSS color names.||

||UseMod:WikiPatches/PrivateUserGroups||Modified from original.  Each user name must be on it's own line and surrounded by curly braces like <tt><nowiki>{e:UserName} or {r:UserName}</nowiki></tt> to indicate can edit or can read.  Otherwise an Authorization Error page will appear [ AuthError ]||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/UserTalkSpace||Modified from original such that each page potentially has a 'Notes' page.  See NotesPages.||

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =
This version of the <nowiki>UseMod</nowiki>wiki engine is highly customized, and adds the following features not available in the standard wiki.pl. 

!!Difference&nbsp;Things!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>~~~</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>$$$$</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki>{{magic: Flash}}</nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki>{{toc NNN}}</nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>{{magic: Discuss}}</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||
||Redirect to Edit Page||By setting action=referer in the <tt><nowiki>$NotFoundPage</nowiki></tt>, the hyperlink created will redirect to the edit page for the name of the page. This is useful to automatically generate edit requests for Notes pages.||
||Block Colors||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{block:key=value|key=value|..}}</nowiki></tt> where key is bgcolor, color, or padding [in pixels].  bgcolor and color accept and standard CSS color names.||

=== Broken Things =
Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

=== Planned Things =
Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!Features Planned!!Description!!
||<tt><nowiki>{{history|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create a timeline using the Timeline javascript widget||
||<tt><nowiki>{{latex|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create LaTex markup for support of scientific notation||

||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||

For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =
This version of the <nowiki>UseMod</nowiki>wiki engine is highly customized, and adds the following features not available in the standard wiki.pl. 

!!Difference&nbsp;Things!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>[ [HomePage/RobertKurcina RobertKurcina] ]</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>[ [HomePage/RobertKurcina RobertKurcina] at 2008.10.12 21:18 ]</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||

||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki>{{toc NNN}}</nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>{{magic: Discuss}}</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||
||Redirect to Edit Page||By setting action=referer in the <tt><nowiki>$NotFoundPage</nowiki></tt>, the hyperlink created will redirect to the edit page for the name of the page. This is useful to automatically generate edit requests for Notes pages.||
||Block Colors||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{block:key=value|key=value|..}}</nowiki></tt> where key is bgcolor, color, or padding [in pixels].  bgcolor and color accept and standard CSS color names.||

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =
This version of the <nowiki>UseMod</nowiki>wiki engine is highly customized, and adds the following features not available in the standard wiki.pl. 

!!Difference&nbsp;Things!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>[ [HomePage/RobertKurcina RobertKurcina] ]</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>[ [HomePage/RobertKurcina RobertKurcina] at 2008.10.12 21:18 ]</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki></nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki>{{toc NNN}}</nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>{{magic: Discuss}}</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||
||Redirect to Edit Page||By setting action=referer in the <tt><nowiki>$NotFoundPage</nowiki></tt>, the hyperlink created will redirect to the edit page for the name of the page. This is useful to automatically generate edit requests for Notes pages.||
||Block Colors||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{block:key=value|key=value|..}}</nowiki></tt> where key is bgcolor, color, or padding [in pixels].  bgcolor and color accept and standard CSS color names.||

||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>{{magic: Discuss}}</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||
||Redirect to Edit Page||By setting action=referer in the <tt><nowiki>$NotFoundPage</nowiki></tt>, the hyperlink created will redirect to the edit page for the name of the page. This is useful to automatically generate edit requests for Notes pages.||
||Block Colors||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{block:key=value|key=value|..}}</nowiki></tt> where key is bgcolor, color, or padding [in pixels].  bgcolor and color accept and standard CSS color names.||
||Message Boxes||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{box:type|message=value}}</nowiki></tt> where type is one of error, alert, warn, info, update, todo, yes, no, delete, or lock. See MessageBox for more information. ||

||UseMod:WikiPatches/EmbeddedBacklinks|class=first|width=300||want||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/NoAnonyms||need; should prevent spammers||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/SurgeProtector||want, unsure if useful||

=== Broken Things =
Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

=== Planned Things =
Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!Features Planned!!Description!!
||<tt><nowiki>{{history|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create a timeline using the Timeline javascript widget||
||<tt><nowiki>{{latex|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create LaTex markup for support of scientific notation||
||<tt><nowiki>{{syntax|language}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Switch between the various markup languages.  Support Markdown, Creole.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{section|WikiPage|header}}</nowiki></tt>||Non-recursively transclude the section text for any page of the identified TOC header||
||<tt><nowiki>{{css|media|stylesheet}}</nowiki></tt>||Added at top of an editor's home-page to alter CSS used before rendering any wiki page.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{feedback|template}}</nowiki></tt>||Use a template [ see above ] to capture feedback or voting information||
||<tt><nowiki>{{columns|color}}</nowiki></tt>||Sort of like the version use on en.wikipedia.org; specify that content following appears in one, two, or three columns.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{graph|type|dimension}}</nowiki></tt>||Add support for javascript-generated graphs.  Bar graphs, line graphs, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{data|id}}</nowiki></tt>||Add dataset storage in two phases.  Phase I is JSON creation for reference by SWFs, and <tt><nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki></tt> libraries.  Phase II is a read/write API possibly via <tt><nowiki>XmlHttpSocket</nowiki></tt> for AJAX or SWF.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{whiteboard|shared}}</nowiki></tt>||Create sketches using Flash, and store the output as a bitmap on the server, and the curves as JSON elements.||

=== Code-related Features =
These items I think I'll need to complete before I submit the code to [http://www.sourceforge.net SourceForge]

!!Features Planned|width=200!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||
||GMT Offset Detection||This could be done via JavaScript and passed automatically to the CGI whenever a page is edited.  Of course, also preset this in the Preferences page as well.||

<blockquote>I really wished that I read more of the [Wiki:UseModWiki UseModWiki] before I started fussing with the 1.0 code.  I see a number of cool ideas from that site that has [Wiki:SunirShah Sunir Shah's] plans for a [Wiki:UseMod UseMod 2.0] that I'd like to include via the available patches.

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =
This version of the <nowiki>UseMod</nowiki>wiki engine is highly customized, and adds the following features not available in the standard wiki.pl. 

!!Difference&nbsp;Things!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>[ [HomePage/RobertKurcina RobertKurcina] ]</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>[ [HomePage/RobertKurcina RobertKurcina] at 2008.10.12 21:18 ]</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki></nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki>{{toc NNN}}</nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>{{magic: Discuss}}</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||
||Redirect to Edit Page||By setting action=referer in the <tt><nowiki>$NotFoundPage</nowiki></tt>, the hyperlink created will redirect to the edit page for the name of the page. This is useful to automatically generate edit requests for Notes pages.||
||Block Colors||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{block:key=value|key=value|..}}</nowiki></tt> where key is bgcolor, color, or padding [in pixels].  bgcolor and color accept and standard CSS color names.||
||Message Boxes||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{box:type|message=value}}</nowiki></tt> where type is one of error, alert, warn, info, update, todo, yes, no, delete, or lock. See MessageBox for more information. ||
||Source View||When a page is locked for Guests, the Edit feature will display a READONLY textarea.||
||Dynamic GotoBar||The GotoBar for users and admins have been consolidated.  By default only the top bar will show, but the Preferences section will allow a bottom one to appear.  The elements of the bars will dynamically enable or disable according to the page or action being viewed.||
||Dynamic Navigation Menu||The left-navigation incorporates user and admin options, and like the GotoBar will enable or disable the items.||
||System Info||The [LocalWiki:action=version action=version] page has been expanded with verbose but static information.||
||Page Creation Prompt||The <tt><nowiki>PageNotFound</nowiki></tt> result will now prompt the user to create a new page if their search request involved a legitimate page name as qualified by the <tt><nowiki>$LinkPattern</nowiki></tt> variable in the wiki code.||

||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>[ [HomePage/RobertKurcina RobertKurcina] ]</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>[ [HomePage/RobertKurcina RobertKurcina] at 2008.10.12 21:18 ]</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Left Navigation||Created 2-column layout with left navigation. Subroutine added <tt><nowiki>GetLeftNav()</nowiki></tt>.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki></nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki>{{toc NNN}}</nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>{{magic: Discuss}}</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||
||Redirect to Edit Page||By setting action=referer in the <tt><nowiki>$NotFoundPage</nowiki></tt>, the hyperlink created will redirect to the edit page for the name of the page. This is useful to automatically generate edit requests for Notes pages.||
||Block Colors||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{block:key=value|key=value|..}}</nowiki></tt> where key is bgcolor, color, or padding [in pixels].  bgcolor and color accept and standard CSS color names.||
||Message Boxes||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{box:type|message=value}}</nowiki></tt> where type is one of error, alert, warn, info, update, todo, yes, no, delete, or lock. See MessageBox for more information. ||
||Source View||When a page is locked for Guests, the Edit feature will display a READONLY textarea.||
||<tt><nowiki>Dynamic GotoBar</nowiki></tt>||The <tt><nowiki>GotoBar</nowiki></tt>for users and admins have been consolidated.  By default only the top bar will show, but the Preferences section will allow a bottom one to appear.  The elements of the bars will dynamically enable or disable according to the page or action being viewed.||
||Dynamic Navigation Menu||The left-navigation incorporates user and admin options, and like the <tt><nowiki>GotoBar</nowiki></tt>will enable or disable the items.||
||System Info||The [LocalWiki:action=version action=version] page has been expanded with verbose but static information.||
||Page Creation Prompt||The <tt><nowiki>PageNotFound</nowiki></tt> result will now prompt the user to create a new page if their search request involved a legitimate page name as qualified by the <tt><nowiki>$LinkPattern</nowiki></tt> variable in the wiki code.||

||UseMod:WikiPatches/NoAnonyms||need; should prevent spammers||
||UseMod:WikiPatches/SurgeProtector||want, unsure if useful||

=== Broken Things =
Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

=== Planned Things =
Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!Features Planned!!Description!!
||<tt><nowiki>{{history|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create a timeline using the Timeline javascript widget||
||<tt><nowiki>{{latex|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create LaTex markup for support of scientific notation||
||<tt><nowiki>{{syntax|language}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Switch between the various markup languages.  Support Markdown, Creole.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{section|WikiPage|header}}</nowiki></tt>||Non-recursively transclude the section text for any page of the identified TOC header||
||<tt><nowiki>{{css|media|stylesheet}}</nowiki></tt>||Added at top of an editor's home-page to alter CSS used before rendering any wiki page.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{feedback|template}}</nowiki></tt>||Use a template [ see above ] to capture feedback or voting information||
||<tt><nowiki>{{columns|color}}</nowiki></tt>||Sort of like the version use on en.wikipedia.org; specify that content following appears in one, two, or three columns.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{graph|type|dimension}}</nowiki></tt>||Add support for javascript-generated graphs.  Bar graphs, line graphs, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{data|id}}</nowiki></tt>||Add dataset storage in two phases.  Phase I is JSON creation for reference by SWFs, and <tt><nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki></tt> libraries.  Phase II is a read/write API possibly via <tt><nowiki>XmlHttpSocket</nowiki></tt> for AJAX or SWF.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||

=== Code-related Features =
These items I think I'll need to complete before I submit the code to [http://www.sourceforge.net SourceForge]

!!Features Planned|width=200!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||
||GMT Offset Detection||This could be done via JavaScript and passed automatically to the CGI whenever a page is edited.  Of course, also preset this in the Preferences page as well.||

<blockquote>I really wished that I read more of the [Wiki:UseModWiki UseModWiki] before I started fussing with the 1.0 code.  I see a number of cool ideas from that site that has [Wiki:SunirShah Sunir Shah's] plans for a [Wiki:UseMod UseMod 2.0] that I'd like to include via the available patches.  I think that this behavior of mine to fix something not broken - and therefore break it - is also known as 'hubris'. -- <cite>[LocalWiki:HomePage/RobertKurcina Robert Kurcina]</cite></blockquote>

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{whiteboard|shared}}</nowiki></tt>||Create sketches using Flash, and store the output as a bitmap on the server, and the curves as JSON elements.||

=== Code-related Features =
These items I think I'll need to complete before I submit the code to [http://www.sourceforge.net SourceForge]

!!Features Planned|width=200!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||
||GMT Offset Detection||This could be done via JavaScript and passed automatically to the CGI whenever a page is edited.  Of course, also preset this in the Preferences page as well.||

I see a number of cool ideas from that site that has [Wiki:SunirShah Sunir Shah's] plans for a [Wiki:UseMod UseMod 2.0] that I'd like to include via the available patches.

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =
This version of the <nowiki>UseMod</nowiki>wiki engine is highly customized, and adds the following features not available in the standard UseMod:wiki.pl. 

!!Major&nbsp;Things|width=300!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki></nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>{{magic: Discuss}}</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||
||Redirect to Edit Page||By setting action=referer in the <tt><nowiki>$NotFoundPage</nowiki></tt>, the hyperlink created will redirect to the edit page for the name of the page. This is useful to automatically generate edit requests for Notes pages.||
||Block Colors||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{block:key=value|key=value|..}}</nowiki></tt> where key is bgcolor, color, or padding [in pixels].  bgcolor and color accept and standard CSS color names.||
||Message Boxes||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{box:type|message=value}}</nowiki></tt> where type is one of error, alert, warn, info, update, todo, yes, no, delete, or lock. See MessageBox for more information. ||
||Source View||When a page is locked for Guests, the Edit feature will display a READONLY textarea.||
||<tt><nowiki>Dynamic GotoBar</nowiki></tt>||The <tt><nowiki>GotoBar</nowiki></tt>for users and admins have been consolidated.  By default only the top bar will show, but the Preferences section will allow a bottom one to appear.  The elements of the bars will dynamically enable or disable according to the page or action being viewed.||
||Dynamic Navigation Menu||The left-navigation incorporates user and admin options, and like the <tt><nowiki>GotoBar</nowiki></tt>will enable or disable the items.||
||System Info||The [LocalWiki:action=version action=version] page has been expanded with verbose but static information.||
||Page Creation Prompt||The <tt><nowiki>PageNotFound</nowiki></tt> result will now prompt the user to create a new page if their search request involved a legitimate page name as qualified by the <tt><nowiki>$LinkPattern</nowiki></tt> variable in the wiki code.||
||Description Text||Descriptions for a page can be created while editing the wikitext for it.  These will display for search results.||
||Formatted Search Results||Search results will display in two columns if a custom threshold of results found is exceeded.||

!!Minor&nbsp;Things|width=300!!Description!!
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki>{{toc NNN}}</nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>[ [HomePage/RobertKurcina RobertKurcina] ]</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>[ [HomePage/RobertKurcina RobertKurcina] at 2008.10.12 21:18 ]</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||

Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!Features Planned|width=300!!Description!!

||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||

||UseMod:WikiPatches/SurgeProtector||hould make it more difficult for spam submission.||
||MeatBall:EditHash||Should make it more difficult for spam submission.||

=== Broken Things =
Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things|width=300!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

=== Planned Things =
Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!New Commands Planned|width=300!!Description!!
||<tt><nowiki>{{history|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create a timeline using the Timeline javascript widget||
||<tt><nowiki>{{latex|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create LaTex markup for support of scientific notation||
||<tt><nowiki>{{syntax|language}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Switch between the various markup languages.  Support Markdown, Creole.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{section|WikiPage|header}}</nowiki></tt>||Non-recursively transclude the section text for any page of the identified TOC header||
||<tt><nowiki>{{css|media|stylesheet}}</nowiki></tt>||Added at top of an editor's home-page to alter CSS used before rendering any wiki page.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{feedback|template}}</nowiki></tt>||Use a template [ see above ] to capture feedback or voting information||
||<tt><nowiki>{{columns|color}}</nowiki></tt>||Sort of like the version use on en.wikipedia.org; specify that content following appears in one, two, or three columns.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{graph|type|dimension}}</nowiki></tt>||Add support for javascript-generated graphs.  Bar graphs, line graphs, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{data|id}}</nowiki></tt>||Add dataset storage in two phases.  Phase I is JSON creation for reference by SWFs, and <tt><nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki></tt> libraries.  Phase II is a read/write API possibly via <tt><nowiki>XmlHttpSocket</nowiki></tt> for AJAX or SWF.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{whiteboard|shared}}</nowiki></tt>||Create sketches using Flash, and store the output as a bitmap on the server, and the curves as JSON elements.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{widget|type}}</nowiki></tt>||Wdigets will be pre-defined as right-hand elements for a HomePage view; calendar, blog roll, rss feeds, tag cloud, favorites, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{embed|type||</nowiki></tt>||This is a generalized way to embed applets for java, flash, Quicktime, Windows Media Player, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{category|names}}</nowiki></tt>||Using a category tag should do two things; create an entry in the appropriate category page, and create a list of pages in place.||

=== Code-related Features =
These items I think I'll need to complete before I submit the code to [http://www.sourceforge.net SourceForge]

!!Features Planned|width=300!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||
||GMT Offset Detection||This could be done via JavaScript and passed automatically to the CGI whenever a page is edited.  Of course, also preset this in the Preferences page as well.||
||Namespaces||This would create separate directories for sets of pages that will not be searched/indexed unless explicitly invoked.||
||<nowiki>WikiFarm</nowiki>||This will create a separate set of directories for each wiki instance, to include data and configuration files.  The idea is to have single CGI script but allow multiple wiki sites without having to modify the HTTPd configuration files.||
||Authentication||The existing UseMod:UseMod system for user management doesn't really support roles, groups, and management of page collections.  By enhancing this feature the NobleWiki engine becomes more realistic as an option for use by others.||

== About this Wiki =
This wiki for Noble Pursuit Games is derived from the freely available [Wiki:UseModWIki UseMod 1.04] wiki engine available as the Wiki:UseModWiki site.  The base install of the NobleWiki engine includes everything listed within the [WikiMinimums StarterPages].

== Features =
This version of the <nowiki>UseMod</nowiki>wiki engine is highly customized, and adds the following features not available in the standard UseMod:wiki.pl. 

!!Major&nbsp;Things|width=300!!Description!!
||Negation Search|class=first||Precede the search term with '!' exclamation point and the search API will find every <em>but</em> that term.||
||Manage Assets||Files uploaded go into the uploads directory as active assets, and can be moved between the uploaded and disabled directories. Supports a naming filter, folder creation, and asset deletion.  See WikiUploads for more information.||
||CSS||Every relevant element has been assigned a CSS class or ID||
||CSS Selection||All CSS files named using the pattern <tt>wiki.*</tt> such as <tt>wiki.css</tt> or <tt>wiki.gray</tt> are made available automatically for selection via the Preferences interface.||
||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki></nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>{{magic: Discuss}}</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||
||Redirect to Edit Page||By setting action=referer in the <tt><nowiki>$NotFoundPage</nowiki></tt>, the hyperlink created will redirect to the edit page for the name of the page. This is useful to automatically generate edit requests for Notes pages.||
||Block Colors||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{color:key=value|key=value|..}}</nowiki></tt> where key is bgcolor, color, or padding [in pixels].  bgcolor and color accept standard CSS color names.||
||Message Boxes||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{box:type|message=value}}</nowiki></tt> where type is one of error, alert, warn, info, update, todo, yes, no, delete, or lock. See MessageBox for more information. ||
||Source View||When a page is locked for Guests, the Edit feature will display a READONLY textarea.||
||<tt><nowiki>Dynamic GotoBar</nowiki></tt>||The <tt><nowiki>GotoBar</nowiki></tt>for users and admins have been consolidated.  By default only the top bar will show, but the Preferences section will allow a bottom one to appear.  The elements of the bars will dynamically enable or disable according to the page or action being viewed.||
||Dynamic Navigation Menu||The left-navigation incorporates user and admin options, and like the <tt><nowiki>GotoBar</nowiki></tt>will enable or disable the items.||
||System Info||The [LocalWiki:action=version action=version] page has been expanded with verbose but static information.||
||Page Creation Prompt||The <tt><nowiki>PageNotFound</nowiki></tt> result will now prompt the user to create a new page if their search request involved a legitimate page name as qualified by the <tt><nowiki>$LinkPattern</nowiki></tt> variable in the wiki code.||
||Description Text||Descriptions for a page can be created while editing the wikitext for it.  These will display for search results.||
||Formatted Search Results||Search results will display in two columns if a custom threshold of results found is exceeded.||

!!Minor&nbsp;Things|width=300!!Description!!
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki>{{toc NNN}}</nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>[ [HomePage/RobertKurcina RobertKurcina] ]</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>[ [HomePage/RobertKurcina RobertKurcina] at 2008.10.12 21:18 ]</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||

||HTML Structure||Made the HTML structure a bit more robust in order to allow advanced CSS styling.  The most significant change is to add <tt><div class='wikicontainer'></div></tt> around the basic HTML ouput.||
||Full Tables||Revised UseMod:WikiPatches/WikiTemplate to allow option switches to control class, style, alignment, width, etc.  See WikiTables for more information||
||Flash Object||Flash SWFs may be added using the <tt><nowiki></nowiki></tt> directive and module. See WikiFlash for more information.||
||<nowiki>LightBox</nowiki> Gallery||Implemented a way to view gallery images.  See WikiGallery for more information.||
||File Icon Boxes||If an asset link has a non-bitmap image extension a box with an icon for that file type is presented.||
||JSON Blocks||Very useful for providing data to various applets like the open-source Flash charting tool.||
||Code Boxes||If code needs to be shown - be it perl, <nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki>, CSS, or even HTML; use [WikiCodeBox Code Boxes].   These will show line-numbering and have syntax-highlighting.||
||User Home||User home pages are to be created and are assumed to exist as sub-pages defined within <tt><nowiki>$HomePagePrefix</nowiki></tt> which is defaulted to be <tt><nowiki>HomePage</nowiki></tt>||
||Discuss Page||This is a work-in-progress.  Essentially add <tt><nowiki>{{magic: Discuss}}</nowiki></tt> in order to activate discussion form and feedback set for a page.  Deactivate form but leave feedback in place by adding parameter locked=true.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>$SimpleLinks</nowiki></tt>||Links like <tt><nowiki>Setup_Box</nowiki></tt> and <tt><nowiki>SetUp_box</nowiki></tt> are allowed.  Both will create bracketed links but not show the underscore character.||
||Expanded <tt><nowiki>FreeLinks and $LinkPattern</nowiki></tt>||Pages that are formed with a single word instead of a WikiWord may only be created by EditorRole and AdminRole.||
||View User Contributions||Use <tt><nowiki>action=rc&userid=RobertKurcina</nowiki></tt> to see all contributions by a given userid.  This is made available in each RecentChanges history line as well.||
||Redirect to Edit Page||By setting action=referer in the <tt><nowiki>$NotFoundPage</nowiki></tt>, the hyperlink created will redirect to the edit page for the name of the page. This is useful to automatically generate edit requests for Notes pages.||
||Block Colors||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{color:key=value|key=value|..}}</nowiki></tt> where key is bgcolor, color, or padding [in pixels].  bgcolor and color accept standard CSS color names.||
||Message Boxes||Introduced custom coloring with <tt><nowiki>{{box:type|message=value}}</nowiki></tt> where type is one of error, alert, warn, info, update, todo, yes, no, delete, or lock. See MessageBox for more information. ||
||Source View||When a page is locked for Guests, the Edit feature will display a READONLY textarea.||
||<tt><nowiki>Dynamic GotoBar</nowiki></tt>||The <tt><nowiki>GotoBar</nowiki></tt>for users and admins have been consolidated.  By default only the top bar will show, but the Preferences section will allow a bottom one to appear.  The elements of the bars will dynamically enable or disable according to the page or action being viewed.||
||Dynamic Navigation Menu||The left-navigation incorporates user and admin options, and like the <tt><nowiki>GotoBar</nowiki></tt>will enable or disable the items.||
||System Info||The [LocalWiki:action=version action=version] page has been expanded with verbose but static information.||
||Page Creation Prompt||The <tt><nowiki>PageNotFound</nowiki></tt> result will now prompt the user to create a new page if their search request involved a legitimate page name as qualified by the <tt><nowiki>$LinkPattern</nowiki></tt> variable in the wiki code.||
||Description Text||Descriptions for a page can be created while editing the wikitext for it.  These will display for search results.||
||Formatted Search Results||Search results will display in two columns if a custom threshold of results found is exceeded.||

!!Minor&nbsp;Things|width=300!!Description!!
||Cancel button|class=first||Added to Edit page; basically <tt><nowiki>onclick='window.location="&ScriptName()?$id;";'</nowiki></tt>||
||Print Link List||Updated this presentation to have a table.  Any non-existent pages identified will show with the 'Create this entry' icon.||
||Recent Changes||Instead of <tt>$FS3</tt> to split the recent changes log, use <tt>\W</tt>.  For example <tt>($ts) = split( /\W/, $fullrc[$i] );</tt>.  Seems to work better for WIN32.||
||Page Lock Icon||Added a small icon to the right of the page title to show that a page is locked or editable.||
||index.cgi||The wiki.pl script has been renamed.||
||IE6 textarea||Added <tt><nowiki><div style='width:100%;'>...</div></nowiki></tt> around the textarea in <tt><nowiki>sub GetTextArea {}</nowiki></tt> to enable 100% width in IE6||
||Table Sorting||Added jQuery Tablesorter 2.0 to engage any table created properly.  See WikiTables for more information.||
||Disabled regex Search||A checkbox near the search form when marked will disable the default search mechanism that allows search terms to be interpreted as regex values.||
||Disable regex back-links||The <tt><nowiki>DoBackLinks</nowiki></tt> subroutine no longer uses search terms as regular expressions.||
||Table Of Contents||The [LocalWiki:WikiTOCs Table of Contents] may be assigned a pixel width parameter as in <tt><nowiki>{{toc NNN}}</nowiki></tt>||
||Expanded Config||Added a number of configuration variables.||
||Windows Config||Set <tt><nowiki>$Windows = 1</nowiki></tt> to remove CGITemp files after uploading assets.||
||Title attribute||Added a title attribute to all links where possible||
||Auto Signature||Insert <tt><nowiki>[ [HomePage/RobertKurcina RobertKurcina] ]</nowiki></tt> to automatically insert username with link to home page; defaults to 'Guest' and no link if not logged in.  Use <tt><nowiki>[ [HomePage/RobertKurcina RobertKurcina] at 2008.10.12 21:18 ]</nowiki></tt> to append timestamp.||
||Bracketed Image URLs with options||<tt><nowiki>[URL upload:image|<options>]</nowiki></tt> There's a number of options available now for images including title, description, boxclear, boxwidth, boxfloat, float, and clear.  The last are for images within a caption box if description is provided.  If description is provided but not title, then the title will show "FIGURE X" where X is computed as the current number of un-titled images||
||Edit Box||The edit box and other textareas are always 100% width in every browser implementation.||
||Lock-out Indicators||Added small symbols to allow quick access to editing a page from the title, and symbols to indicate that a page is locked.  <tt>'&not;'</tt> is that symbol prefixed to a locked page.||
||Naming Filter||Provide multiple keywords with or with negated terms to filter the names returned from <tt>backlinks</tt>, <tt>search</tt>, or the asset management interface.||

== Possible Patches =
!!Patches Under Consideration|width=300!!Description!!

=== Broken Things =
Here are some standard [UseMod:UseMod UseMod] wiki.pl features that have been removed; not to worry - they'll return.  For a list of actual defects, see WikiBugs.

!!Broken Things|width=300!!Description!!
||<tt>T(<string>)</tt>|class=first||These are removed for now to declutter the perl code.  Will return as a set of configuration files - one per language.||
||<tt>Ts(<string>)</tt>||With T() being messed with, and the fact that Ts() calls T() ... well, this is broken as well.||
||<tt>Tss(<string>)</tt>||See above.  Tss() -> Ts() -> T()||

=== Planned Things =
Not sure when these will come in, but definitely on the TODO list;

!!New Commands Planned|width=300!!Description!!
||<tt><nowiki>{{history|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create a timeline using the Timeline javascript widget||
||<tt><nowiki>{{latex|events}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Create LaTex markup for support of scientific notation||
||<tt><nowiki>{{syntax|language}}</nowiki></tt>|class=first||Switch between the various markup languages.  Support Markdown, Creole.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{section|WikiPage|header}}</nowiki></tt>||Non-recursively transclude the section text for any page of the identified TOC header||
||<tt><nowiki>{{css|media|stylesheet}}</nowiki></tt>||Added at top of an editor's home-page to alter CSS used before rendering any wiki page.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{feedback|template}}</nowiki></tt>||Use a template [ see above ] to capture feedback or voting information||
||<tt><nowiki>{{columns|color}}</nowiki></tt>||Sort of like the version use on en.wikipedia.org; specify that content following appears in one, two, or three columns.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{graph|type|dimension}}</nowiki></tt>||Add support for javascript-generated graphs.  Bar graphs, line graphs, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{data|id}}</nowiki></tt>||Add dataset storage in two phases.  Phase I is JSON creation for reference by SWFs, and <tt><nowiki>JavaScript</nowiki></tt> libraries.  Phase II is a read/write API possibly via <tt><nowiki>XmlHttpSocket</nowiki></tt> for AJAX or SWF.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{blog|entryid}}</nowiki></tt>||This would be a new GUI that writes to a dataset page under <tt><nowiki>PageId/Blogentryid</nowiki></tt> and support RSS 1.0.  Features are editing, archive, publishing, and a WYSIWYG.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{form|formid}}</nowiki></tt>||Create a simple configuration-driven form generator that would write to a dataset page.  Simple form templates should be made available such as voting + graph-view, feedback/mailer, calculation, and dataset data-entry + graph-view.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{whiteboard|shared}}</nowiki></tt>||Create sketches using Flash, and store the output as a bitmap on the server, and the curves as JSON elements.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{widget|type}}</nowiki></tt>||Wdigets will be pre-defined as right-hand elements for a HomePage view; calendar, blog roll, rss feeds, tag cloud, favorites, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{embed|type</nowiki></tt>||This is a generalized way to embed applets for java, flash, Quicktime, Windows Media Player, etc.||
||<tt><nowiki>{{category|names}}</nowiki></tt>||Using a category tag should do two things; create an entry in the appropriate category page, and create a list of pages in place.||

=== Code-related Features =
These items I think I'll need to complete before I submit the code to [http://www.sourceforge.net SourceForge]

!!Features Planned|width=300!!Description!!
||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||
||GMT Offset Detection||This could be done via JavaScript and passed automatically to the CGI whenever a page is edited.  Of course, also preset this in the Preferences page as well.||
||Namespaces||This would create separate directories for sets of pages that will not be searched/indexed unless explicitly invoked.||
||<nowiki>WikiFarm</nowiki>||This will create a separate set of directories for each wiki instance, to include data and configuration files.  The idea is to have single CGI script but allow multiple wiki sites without having to modify the HTTPd configuration files.||
||Authentication||The existing UseMod:UseMod system for user management doesn't really support roles, groups, and management of page collections.  By enhancing this feature the NobleWiki engine becomes more realistic as an option for use by others.||
