||Update <tt>PRINT</tt>||All of the incidences of the <tt>PRINT</tt> command in the code need to be replaced with a String glob.  This will make the code more flexible.||
||Localization||I see the <tt>trans.pl</tt> and <tt>umtrans.pl</tt>.  I'm not sure that this is the best way to support I18N.  For example, the wiki engine should be able to serve up content localized to a specific language when given a preference.  This requires sub-directories by language in the database such as <tt>//en/content1</tt>  or <tt>//ja/content2</tt>.||
||Lock List||The administrator view needs to be able to determine which pages have been locked, and which pages are private.||
||Visitor's Log||This would be an audit trail of visitors by IP address and possibly by logon ID.||
||Home Page Binding||Once Preferences are set and a logon ID is determined, the visitor should be given the option to create a Home Page or to redirect to it if it already exists.||
||GMT Offset Detection||This could be done via JavaScript and passed automatically to the CGI whenever a page is edited.  Of course, also preset this in the Preferences page as well.||
||Namespaces||This would create separate directories for sets of pages that will not be searched/indexed unless explicitly invoked.||
||<nowiki>WikiFarm</nowiki>||This will create a separate set of directories for each wiki instance, to include data and configuration files.  The idea is to have single CGI script but allow multiple wiki sites without having to modify the HTTPd configuration files.||
||Authentication||The existing UseMod:UseMod system for user management doesn't really support roles, groups, and management of page collections.  By enhancing this feature the NobleWiki engine becomes more realistic as an option for use by others.||
